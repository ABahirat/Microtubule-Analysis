Here's what I was thinking so far for structure:

Obersvations: change in length of microtubules. Since this is a
                continous value we will have to bin the values. I
                think that patrick was talking about 5 bins but
                that will deend on our data. Maybe a bin for very negative,
                negative, zero, positive, and very positive. This might take
                some adjustment though.

States: Growing, shrinking, pause. We have talked about this a good amount so
                won't go into much depth.

Program structure: Probably a CLI menu where you can pick a file to train off of
                and on option to run vertibi and check agaisnt a file and then
                posible other HMM algos. 

Sorry this isn't super in depth I need to leave my place for the rest of the
afternoon so I can't write up anything long. I'll probably get to work a little
on this tomorrow.
